# PimEyes-Crack
This "Crack" is simply a couple of css styles that improve your experience while using the face-recognition service "pimeyes.com"

These css styles un-blur the text (Kind-of useless, since the URLs shown have some kind of obfuscation applied).
It also removes the "buy premium" overlay from the images, so you can download them or reverse-image-search them with an [addon like search-by-image](https://github.com/dessant/search-by-image)
It also allows you to SELECT the un-blur'ed text.

You can either load the styles in "styles.css" manually, or import "userstyle-import" from the [Stylus Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/).
