This "Crack" is simply a couple of css styles that improve your experience while using the face-recognition service "pimeyes.com"

These css style un-blurs and un-fades the URLs, removes the "UNLOCK" button and removes the on-click event from URLs, so you can select them easier.

Although the URLs are obfuscated and cropped to 30 characters, you might still be able to get back the original URL if you recognize the domain/cdn format.

These CSS style also removes the "buy premium" overlay from the images, so you can download them or reverse-image-search them with an [addon like search-by-image](https://github.com/dessant/search-by-image). Although in recent updates, they made it so everything but the face is blurred. *You'll have to crop the face, and reverse image search _that_* and hope to get the original picture.

You can either load the styles in ``styles.css`` manually, or import ``userstyle-import`.json`` from the [Stylus Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/).

BTW, you can use any VPN/Proxy to bypass the search-limit. Just make sure to clean all storage for that domain before doing that (Cookies, Site Preferences, Cache, Indexed DB, Local Storage, Service Workers, and Plugin Data); To facilitate this, I recommend the [Cookie AutoDelete Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/).
